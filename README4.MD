# Set up Display

These instructions are relevanyt for you if you are using a Raspberry pi with an Adafruit LCD Display kit.

The next step is to set up the Raspberry Pi that will display the temperature and humidity. The hardware for this will have been assembled already (see README.MD).
## Download and install Adafruit drivers
You need to install some Python libraries before you can sue the LCD dispaly kit.

The drivers are on the School's Giblab repository at this URL:  
[http://ula.its.rmit.edu.au:1080/ians/adafruit-charlcd](http://ula.its.rmit.edu.au:1080/ians/adafruit-charlcd)

Follow the instructions.  Make sure your are folowing the instructions for the Raspberry Pi (not the Beaglebone Black).

## The display program
The Python program that will read the database and control the LCD display will have been downloaded when you cloned the Gitlab repository.  The Python file you want is: **Home_Weather_Display.py**.

Before you run this program, read through the code because you need to make a change a line of code.  There is a comment in the code to tell you what to change.
