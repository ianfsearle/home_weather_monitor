# Set up Display

These instructions are relevanyt for you if you are using a Raspberry pi with a GrovePi LCD Display.

The next step is to set up the Raspberry Pi that will display the temperature and humidity. The hardware for this will have been assembled already (see README.MD).
## Download and install GrovePi Drivers
The software and installation instructions to work the GrovePi Hat are available at this URL:<br />

You can run the blink test program if you like.  The LED module will be in the kit of Grove Pi parts.

## The display program
The Python program that will read the database and control the LCD display will have been downloaded when you cloned the Gitlab repository.  The Python file you want is: **Home_Weather_Grove_Display.py**.

Before you run this program, read through the code because you need to make a change a line of code.  There is a comment in the code to tell you what to change.
